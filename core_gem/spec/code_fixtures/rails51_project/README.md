This is a very barebone rails project that we use to run tests.

There are tests using both mini-test and rspec.

If you need to test a rails feature for its interaction with DeepCover, here is the place to do so.

Note that there are multiple versions of rails, which support different versions of ruby, so we have many mini projects like this one for each version that we need for tests.
