# DeepCover

Deep Cover aims to be the best coverage tool for Ruby code:

* more accurate line coverage
* branch coverage
* can be used as a drop-in replacement for the built-in Coverage library.

It reports a more accurate picture of your code usage. In particular a line is considered covered if and only if it is entirely executed:

```
def foo(something: false)
  bar if something  # => This is considered covered by builtin coverage,
                    #    even though `bar` might not even exist
end

# somewhere in a test:
foo
```

Optionally, branch coverage will detect if some branches are never taken. In the following example, `test_foo` only provides values for `x` that respond to `:to_s`, thus the implicit `else` is never tested (i.e. a value of `x` that does not respond to `:to_s`)

```
def foo(x)
  x = x.to_s if x.respond_to? :to_s
  # ...
end

def test_foo
  assert_equal something, foo(42)
  assert_equal something_else, foo(:hello)
end
```

## Examples

These examples are direct outputs from our HTML reporter:

* [Rails' `activesupport`](https://deep-cover.github.io/rails-cover/activesupport/)
* [Rails' `activerecord`](https://deep-cover.github.io/rails-cover/activerecord/)

## Installation

    gem install deep-cover

### Command line interface (for a Rails app or a Gem):

An easy way to check coverage, without any configuration needed:

    deep-cover /path/to/rails/app/or/gem

This assumes your project has a `Gemfile`, and that your default `rake` task is set to execute all tests (otherwise set the `--command` option)

It also uses our builtin HTML reporter. Check the produced `coverage/index.html`.

### Builtin Coverage (including SimpleCov) users

Add to your Gemfile `gem 'deep-cover'`, then run `bundle`.

Before you require `coverage` or `simplecov`, do a `require 'deep-cover/builtin_takeover'`.

For example, the `test/test_helper.rb` file for `simplecov` users will look like

```
require 'deep_cover/builtin_takeover'
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start
# rest of `test_helper.rb`
```

## Usage

### Configuration

`configure` is used to specify how specific `DeepCover` should be and which files it should analyse. The following code reflects the default settings:

```
DeepCover.configure do
  ignore_uncovered :raise, :default_arguments
  detect_uncovered :trivial_if
  # TODO
  cover_paths %w[app lib]
end
```

### Low level usage

```
# Setup
require 'deep-cover'
DeepCover.configure { ignore_uncovered :trivial_if }
# Cover
DeepCover.cover do
  require 'my_file_to_cover'
  require 'my_other_file_to_cover'
end
require 'this_file_wont_be_covered'
tests.run()
puts DeepCover.line_coverage('foo')
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` then `rake dev:install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

For detailed analysis:

`deep-cover -d -e "if(:try_me); puts 'cool'; end"`

To run one of the specs in `spec`:

`bin/cov boolean`

### Status

Currently in heavy development. *Alpha stage, API subject to change every day*. Best time to get involved though ;-)
