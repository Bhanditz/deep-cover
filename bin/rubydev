#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This launches ruby with the --dev option. This options makes short-lived jruby scripts
# run much faster. To make it simpler to than the --dev option, this command will also
# search on the PATH to find the file to execute. So you can do `bin/rubydev rspec`, and
# it will work as expected, unlike with `ruby`, which expects a direct path to the file.

# You may want to add this function directly to your bashrc
# This way you can do `rubydev rspec`, instead of having to do `bin/rubydev rspec`
# Extra alias suggestion: `alias jrspec='rubydev rspec $@'`
